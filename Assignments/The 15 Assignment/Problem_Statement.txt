You need to do a small assignment of creating a 3x3 matrix of integers with the following conditions.

1) You can use 9 integers between 1 to 9 where is number is unique (i.e. no repeating of numbers)
2) Sum of all the row elements will be 15
3) Sum of all the column elements will be 15
4) Sum of all the diagonal elements will be 15
5) You cannot simply guess a combination and assign with array elements.
You have to find the combination technically in the program.

Therefor, the array will look like follows:

[n1 ]   [n2 ]   [n3 ] 

[n4]    [n5 ]   [n6 ]

[n7 ]   [n8 ]   [n9 ]

where each number is unique and satisfies the following conditions:
n1+n2+n3=15
n4+n5+n6=15
n7+n8+n9=15
n1+n4+n7=15
n2+n5+n8=15
n3+n6+n9=15
n1+n5+n9=15
n3+n5+n7=15
